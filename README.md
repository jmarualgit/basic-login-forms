# Project Title

From [Odin Project's intermediate project for forms](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form), I chose to do a login page with custom behaviors for incorrect inputs, selected inputs, and submittions/lack of. I aim to also have a great CSS design.
